Implementing [Crafting Interpreters'](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html) interpreter in rust, 
currently only the java part (Part II), maybe the C part (Part III) in the future

This implementation focuses on a more imperative + functional approach, as opposed to the original java version,
which is mainly OOP, taking advantage of rust's iterators and error handling, as well as the fact that I don't have to
write java
